# Machine-Translation-Seq2Seq
Built a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model for machine translation using PyTorch. Implemented an encoder-decoder architecture with LSTM layers to translate sentences from one language to another. The model captures long-term dependencies in text, making it effective for handling varying sentence structures across languages.
